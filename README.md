# Created React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This project served as practice in React as well as a personal introduction of using APIs. From the main page, you could type in a country and see the selected country light up. After clicking on the country, you will be prompted to select a category of news you would like to see from that country. Then, you will be directed to a page which contains descriptions and links to the desired news articles. If these articles are in another language, you can decide to translate them with the appropriate button.

## How to run

This project utilizes two APIs: NewsAPI and Google cloud translate API. I only have the API developer subscription, so there is unfortunately no url to use this website appropriately. If you would like to see how the program runs, please visit my online portfolio and select projects->otherprojects->GeoNews. If you would still like to use this project, you can make a copy of this program, install npm and npx, and type 'npm start' in the terminal
